%p The user is the sole responsible of the content and files made available on the platform, and therefore commits to not publishing (or uploading) any file (i.e., video, audio, text, etc.) which could be subject to intellectual (or industrial) property rights or third parties, unless the legal owner of said rights has provided them with a formal license or authorisation compatible with the license in force on this platform.

Onodo will not be held responsible for the cancellation of access to the platform. Onodo reserves the right to fully or partially limit the access of certain Users, as well as to cancel, suspend, block or delete certain kinds of content through the use of technological tools adequate to that effect, if it has reliable knowledge that the stored and/or disseminated data or activity is illicit or that it violates the assets or rights of a third party.

In any case, the user has the possibility of configuring their browser to disable the installation of these files.
%p Onodo will not be held responsible for the external links, which might be included on the platform, since it has no means of control on them. Therefore, the users access the content under their own responsibility and under the conditions of use imposed by them.
